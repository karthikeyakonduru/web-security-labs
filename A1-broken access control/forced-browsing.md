🔍 OWASP Juice Shop – Forced Browsing (A01: Broken Access Control)

While working on OWASP Juice Shop labs, I identified a Forced Browsing vulnerability caused by improper access control on an unlinked endpoint.

📌 Details:

Endpoint accessed: /ftp/

Issue: Directory accessible without authentication

Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive files

OWASP Category: A01 – Broken Access Control

🧠 This exercise reinforced how misconfigured access controls on forgotten or hidden paths can lead to serious information disclosure.

Documented as part of my pentesting learning portfolio.
